# About
BlitzScouter v1 is the old scouting system New Berlin Blitz had made and used. The system hosted a web server and required that all devices maintained a constant internet connection in order to work. Not only was this unreliable, but also costed the team money in order to maintain cellular plans on all scouting devices. As a result, we created the new [BlitzScouter](https://github.com/NB-Blitz/BlitzScouter) that runs offline on android devices. However, this system still works if anyone would like to utilize it.

# Download
***Note:** BlitzScouter v1 has long since been deprecated and is not reccommended for competition usage. Our new scouting app is located [here](https://github.com/NB-Blitz/BlitzScouter).*
1. Download and run the the latest [release](https://github.com/NB-Blitz/BlitzScouter-Old/releases) on a host computer running windows.
2. Port forward the port 5001 on the host computer
3. Search for the public ip of the host computer
4. Open & bookmark http://(public ip):5001 on every scouting device

# Using
The app is split up into 2 sections: Dashboard and Scouting. 

## Scouting
Scouting is located on the homepage of the website. By entering a team number and match number, you can scout a match using a variety of input methods. This site can be running on any scouting device and be given to match scouters.

## Dashboard
The dashboard is located at http://(public ip):5001/dash and is primarily used by the scouting lead & mentors to share match data. The dashboard contains pages with team data, match data, and scout editing in order to manage data. In addition, match comments can be inputted by leads or mentors to give drive team a better strategic understading of the upcoming match.
